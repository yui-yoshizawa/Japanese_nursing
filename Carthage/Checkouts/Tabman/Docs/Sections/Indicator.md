The `TMBarIndicator` indicator is purely responsible for displaying the current paging state, complementing the state displayed in the bar buttons.

`TMBarIndicator` also dictates where it needs to be displayed in the bar, via `displayMode` - a property that must be provided by any `TMBarIndicator` subclass.
